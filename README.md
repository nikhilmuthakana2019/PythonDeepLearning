# End-to-End Deep Learning for Autonomous Driving

Using Python and its libraries, this project aims to:
  - Perform filtering and apply masks to the input video
  - Use a Convolutional Neural Network to detect road features
  - Use the findings to implement a End-to-End network to by-pass the manually defined process

### Current progress

First commit of the code with video reading and filtering.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
- OpenCV library
